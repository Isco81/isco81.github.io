## Overview

Argonz-ML is a lightweight machine learning library designed for JavaScript developers. It simplifies the implementation of common machine learning algorithms. The library is easy to use and integrates well with Node.js applications. 

## Installation

To install Argonz-ML, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install argonz-ml
```

After installation, you can start using the library in your projects.

## Usage

To use Argonz-ML, import the library in your JavaScript file. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
const ArgonzML = require('argonz-ml');

// Create a new decision tree model
const model = new ArgonzML.DecisionTree();

// Train the model with your data
model.train(trainingData, trainingLabels);

// Make predictions
const predictions = model.predict(testData);
```

For more detailed examples, refer to the documentation in the repository.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint for fast performance.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that is easy to integrate.
- **Support for Multiple Algorithms**: Includes decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, SVM, and XGBoost.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Node.js applications.

## Algorithms

Argonz-ML supports several popular machine learning algorithms:

### Decision Trees

Decision trees are used for classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the data into branches based on feature values.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

### Random Forest

Random forests are an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a powerful classification method that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.

### XGBoost

XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed for speed and performance. It is widely used in machine learning competitions.
