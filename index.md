## Overview

This repository contains a powerful chat-bot designed to convert natural language queries about patient demographics into SQL queries. Utilizing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology and the Langchain framework, this tool streamlines the process of data retrieval from a database, making it easier for healthcare professionals to access vital information quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: The chat-bot understands user queries in plain English.
- **SQL Generation**: Automatically generates SQL queries based on user input.
- **Integration with Vector Databases**: Leverages FAISS for efficient data retrieval.
- **Easy to Use**: User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- **Customizable**: Modify the bot to suit specific needs and preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Langchain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- **Melvius**: A component for enhancing the capabilities of the chat-bot.
- **RAG**: Combines retrieval and generation to improve response accuracy.
- **Vertex AI**: Utilized for machine learning model deployment.
