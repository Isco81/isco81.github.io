## Overview

The **IRC Discord Bridge** is a powerful bot designed to synchronize messages between IRC and Discord channels. This Python-based solution allows users to communicate seamlessly across platforms, making it easier to manage communities that use both IRC and Discord. Whether you are a developer looking to enhance your community engagement or a user wanting to connect with friends across platforms, this bot provides a straightforward way to bridge the gap.

## Features

- **Message Synchronization**: Automatically relay messages between specified IRC and Discord channels.
- **User Mapping**: Map users between IRC and Discord to maintain context.
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Connect multiple IRC-Discord channel pairs.
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily adjust settings to suit your needs.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project or modify it for your requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with the IRC Discord Bridge bot, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An IRC server
- A Discord bot token
- Basic knowledge of Python and command-line interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isco81/irc-discord-bridge-python-bot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd irc-discord-bridge-python-bot
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the bot, you need to configure it:

1. Create a configuration file named `config.json` in the project directory.
2. Add the following JSON structure to the file:

   ```json
   {
       "discord_token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
       "irc": {
           "server": "irc.example.com",
           "port": 6667,
           "channels": [
               "#your-irc-channel"
           ]
       },
       "discord": {
           "channels": [
               "YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID"
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

3. Replace the placeholders with your actual Discord bot token, IRC server details, and channel IDs.

### Running the Bot

To run the bot, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see log messages indicating that the bot is connecting to IRC and Discord.

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will start relaying messages between the specified IRC and Discord channels. Users can send messages in either channel, and the bot will handle the synchronization.

### User Mapping

To ensure that messages are attributed correctly, the bot attempts to map users between IRC and Discord. If a user does not exist in the mapping, the bot will use a generic username.

### Commands

The bot supports several commands to manage its functionality:

- **!help**: Displays a list of available commands.
- **!status**: Shows the current status of the bot and connected channels.
- **!config**: Displays the current configuration settings.
